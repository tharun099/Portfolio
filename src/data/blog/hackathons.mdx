# Crushing Hackathons: Systems Over Motivation

In a hackathon, you don't have time to wait for inspiration. As the sources suggest, **"Motivation is fleeting; systems are permanent"**. To win, you need to rely on a framework that prioritizes functional code over abstract perfection.

## 1. The Pre-Build: Needs Over Design

The biggest mistake developers make is opening VS Code and staring at a blank screen wondering about colors. Before you write a single line of `npm create-next-app`, follow **Rule 1: Needs over Design**.

- **Identify the Core Problem:** What is the main problem the project solves?
- **Define the Target Audience:** Who is using this?
- **Functional First:** Don't worry about typefaces or animations yet. Focus on creating a functional and usable product.

**Tip:** Use the **Grayscale Method**. Design your UI in black and white first to force a focus on hierarchy, padding, and margins.

## 2. Rapid Development with JavaScript Foundations

Hackathons require speed. Leveraging modern JavaScript allows you to write cleaner, more reusable code.

### Reusable Logic
Use **Arrow Functions** for short, simple operations and **Destructuring** to keep your data handling clean.

```javascript
// Quick data extraction for a hackathon demo
const handleUser = ({ name, role = "participant" }) => {
  return `Welcome ${name}, Role: ${role}`;
};
```

### Dynamic Content
Use **Template Literals** for easy string formatting when displaying dynamic data or notifications.

## 3. Architecture for Speed: Next.js Routing

In a hackathon, your folder structure is your roadmap. Next.js **App Router** allows you to scale your project quickly.

- **Dynamic Routes:** Use `[productId]` folders to handle multiple items without creating individual pages.
- **Catch-All Segments:** Use `[...slug]` if you need to handle unknown nested paths for documentation or multi-level features.

```sh
src/app/
  dashboard/
    [userId]/
      page.tsx  # Instantly generates user profiles
```

## 4. Don't Sacrifice Security for Speed

Even in a 24-hour sprint, a security leak can disqualify your project. Avoid the common mistake of verifying sessions only at the page level.

**The Hackathon-Safe Pattern:**
Implement a **Data Access Layer**. Centralize your data requests and authorization logic so you don't accidentally leak data when reusing components.

```typescript
// app/data/todo/get-todos.ts
import 'server-only'; 
import { requireUser } from '../user/require-user';

export async function getTodos() {
  await requireUser(); // Security check inside the data layer
  return await prisma.todo.findMany();
}
```

## 5. Managing the Chaos

Managing a 24-48 hour workload requires an **"External Brain"**. 

- **Use a System:** Use tools like **TickTick** or Kanban boards to track tasks, set reminders, and avoid missing deadlines.
- **Dopamine Management:** Avoid the trap of "easy dopamine" like scrolling social media during breaks. **"If you can control your dopamine, you can control everything"**.
- **Build in Public:** Share your progress on X (formerly Twitter) or LinkedIn. Public accountability forces consistency and can attract interest before the final pitch.

## Conclusion

The best way to learn and win is by **"Building the real thing as early as possible"**. Don't get stuck in abstract planning. Code, hit an error, find the reason, learn the new topic, and repeat.

**Analogy for Hackathon Success:**
A hackathon is like a **timed obstacle course**. Most people fail because they stop to polish their shoes (designing too much). The winner is the one who has a pre-planned route (systems), wears the right gear (JS/Next.js basics), and keeps their eyes on the finish line (user needs).

**Note on Information:** While the strategies for development, design, and productivity are directly supported by the sources, their specific application as a "Hackathon Guide" is an original synthesis of those materials. You may wish to independently verify hackathon-specific rules for any competition you enter.
