## Overview

The **Tweet Generator Chrome Extension** allows users to select text on any webpage and instantly generate well-crafted tweets while preserving the original context.

Users can:
- Customize the **tone** of the tweet  
- Control the **tweet length**  
- Regenerate tweets for variations  
- Copy tweets with a single click  
- Track real-time character counts  

All of this happens inside a clean and intuitive Chrome extension popup—no tab switching required.

## Key Features

- **Text Selection Anywhere**  
  Select content from any webpage and send it directly to the extension.

- **AI-Powered Tweet Generation**  
  Uses Google’s Gemini AI to generate concise and engaging tweets.

- **Custom Writing Tones**  
  Switch between tones to match your audience or intent.

- **Flexible Tweet Lengths**  
  Generate short, medium, or long tweets.

- **Regenerate & Iterate**  
  Instantly generate alternative tweet versions.

- **Copy to Clipboard**  
  One-click copy for quick sharing.

- **Live Character Counter**  
  Ensures tweets stay within platform limits.

## File Structure & Purpose

### `manifest.json`
- Chrome extension configuration file  
- Defines permissions, content scripts, and metadata  
- Registers the popup interface  

---

### `src/components/TweetGenerator.tsx`
- Main UI component for tweet generation  
- Manages:
  - Selected text
  - Tweet options (tone and length)
  - Generated output  
- Handles API calls and user interactions  
- Renders controls and tweet preview  

---

### `src/lib/gemini.ts`
- Integrates **Google Gemini AI**  
- Formats prompts for tweet generation  
- Processes AI responses  
- Handles API errors gracefully  

---

### `src/content.tsx`
- Content script injected into web pages  
- Detects text selection events  
- Communicates selected text to the extension  
- Uses `chrome.storage` for persistence  

---

### `src/types.ts`
- Centralized TypeScript definitions  
- Defines interfaces for:
  - Tweet options
  - API responses  
- Stores constants for tone and length options  

---

### `src/App.tsx`
- Root component of the extension  
- Provides layout and structure  
- Handles component organization  

---

### `vite.config.ts`
- Build configuration using Vite  
- Optimizes assets for production  
- Supports fast development and extension packaging  

---

## 🛠 Development Process

### 1. Initial Setup
- Created a **Vite + React + TypeScript** project  
- Configured the Chrome extension manifest  
- Set up the build pipeline for extension packaging  

---

### 2. Core Functionality
- Implemented text selection detection on web pages  
- Integrated Gemini AI for tweet generation  
- Added tone and length customization  

---

### 3. UI Development
- Designed a clean and intuitive interface  
- Built responsive components with Tailwind CSS  
- Added loading states and error handling  
- Created a Twitter-like tweet preview  

---

### 4. Extension Integration
- Enabled communication between content scripts and the popup  
- Implemented data persistence with `chrome.storage`  
- Ensured seamless cross-script messaging  

---

### 5. Polish & Optimization
- Added copy and regenerate functionality  
- Improved user feedback and error messaging  
- Optimized performance and bundle size

## Security Considerations

- API key stored securely using environment variables  
- Enforced content security policies  
- Safe handling of user-selected text  
- Proper validation and error handling  

---

## Future Improvements

1. Tweet scheduling  
2. Thread generation support  
3. Multi-platform social sharing  
4. Advanced customization options
